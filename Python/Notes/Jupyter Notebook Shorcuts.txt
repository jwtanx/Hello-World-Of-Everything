First, we need to know that they are 2 modes in the Jupyter Notebook App: command mode and edit mode. I’ll start with the shortcuts shared between the two modes.

Shortcuts in both modes:
Shift + Enter 	run the current cell, select below
Ctrl + Enter 	run selected cells
Alt + Enter 	run the current cell, insert below
Ctrl + S 		save and checkpoint

While in command mode (press Esc to activate):
Enter 			take you into edit mode
H 				show all shortcuts
Up 				select cell above
Down 			select cell below
Shift + Up 		extend selected cells above
Shift + Down 	extend selected cells below
A 				insert cell above
B 				insert cell below
X 				cut selected cells
C 				copy selected cells
V 				paste cells below
Shift + V 		paste cells above
D, D 			delete selected cells
Z 				undo cell deletion
S 				Save and Checkpoint
Y 				change the cell type to Code
M 				change the cell type to Markdown
P 				open the command palette.

This dialog helps you run any command by name. It’s really useful if you don’t know some shortcut or when you don’t have a shortcut for the wanted command.

Command Palette
Shift + Space 		scroll notebook up
Space 				scroll notebook down

While in edit mode (press Enter to activate)
Esc 				take you into command mode
Tab 				code completion or indent
Shift + Tab 		tooltip
Ctrl + ] 			indent
Ctrl + [ 			dedent
Ctrl + A 			select all
Ctrl + D 			delete the current row
Ctrl + Z 			undo
Ctrl + Y 			redo or [Ctrl + Shift + Z]
Ctrl + Home 		go to cell start
Ctrl + End 			go to cell end
Ctrl + Left 		go one word left
Ctrl + Right 		go one word right
Ctrl + Shift + P 	open the command palette
Down 				move cursor down
Up 					move cursor up

These are the shortcuts I use in my daily work. If you still need something that is not mentioned here you can find it in the keyboard shortcuts dialog (H). You can also edit existing or add more shortcuts from the Help > Edit Keyboard Shortcuts link in the menu bar. Clicking the link will open a dialog. At the bottom of it there are rules for adding or editing shortcuts. You need to use hyphens - to represent keys that should be pressed at the same time.
For example, I added a shortcut Ctrl-R for the restart kernel and run all cells command.
